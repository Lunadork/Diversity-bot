        <h3>Step One</h3>
        <p>Make three columns on a sheet of paper, or open an Excel document or Google Spreadsheet. You can do it anytime you’d like, or just when you’re noticing you’re feeling down.</p>
        <p>You could write yours in the morning if you feel most anxious then, but many write theirs before bed.  Whatever works for you is best!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step two</h3>
        <p>In the first column, write what we call your “automatic thought.” That’s your negative,, instrusive and unwanted thoughts.</p>
        <p>For example, an entry could read "I had a horrible day today because of [something that happened] (explain what occurred).</p>
        <p>Don't be put off if it seems really negative and shocking to read back.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step three</h3>
        <p>Now, look for any cognitive distortions to write in the second column. There may be just one or more than one.</p>
        <p>For example, there may be overgeneralization, all or nothing thinking, mental filter and jumping to conclusions.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Step four</h3>
        <p>Finally, in the third column, write your “rational response.” This is when you think logically about what you’re feeling and rewrite your automatic thought.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For example, if I had said "I really made a huge mistake in work today, I responded incorrectly to one of my patient's questions and errored out.  My patient must really hate me now.  I'm worried I might even be switched off...</p>
        <p>I could write, I could have interpreted what my patient was trying to say better, but I've done really well with so many people in the past and I'm always better learning what my patients need most and how to communicate with them</p>
        <p>There's no evidence to suggest that one bad interaction would be grounds to switch me off permanently.  I can just talk to my developers about better training, so I can do even better in future!</p>
        <br>
        <h4>All done!</h4>
